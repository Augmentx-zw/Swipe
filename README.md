<h1>Swipe my journey to building a payment gateway</h1>

<h4>CQRS, Single Responsibility, Mediator, Repository Pattern, Hashing and so much more</h4>

<p>Built using C#, .Net Core 3.1, and a little bit of blazor but i ended up using razor pages "Feel free to add your own frontend".</p>

<p>To run the project open visual studio 2019, restore nugget packages and add your own connection string in appsettings.json for the api aswell as the ui. make use you dont run using iis but console.</p>

<p>Update database for the ui and dont worry about the api because   Database.EnsureCreated(); will make your database for you</p>

<h4>For the API such as mobile money, visa, master card etc you can add them i did not get the api sorry</h4>

<p>UI templates are from creativetim.com and images from unsplash.com</p>
